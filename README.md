# RaspDac Mini

This branch is still in testing phase.
Once the scripting procedure is complete this repository will expose methods to build a patch for Volumio and moOde Audio on a Raspdac Mini OLED version. Same thing for piCore is WIP.
This approach will replace the old preconfigured images way of customizing the RDMOLED.
